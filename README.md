Homework_10_Teams:
This homework required me to build a Node CLI process that takes in information about the employees and generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.   This process also required that unit testing should be done and that all tests passed.

    #User Story:
        As a manager
        I want to generate a webpage that displays my teams basic information
        So that I have a quick access to emails and GitHub profiles 
    #Instructions:
        •	Build a software engineering team generator command line application.
        •	The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager, and then information
            about team members.  The information can be a mix of engineers and interns.
        •	Application must pass all unit testing.
        •	Once the teams are built, the application should create an HTML file that displays the formatted        
            team roster based on the information provided.  
        •	Open in Browser to see the finish product
 
    #Tools:
        •	Test Scripts, HTML templates for each employee, Employee Class file, with Subclass of Engineer, Intern  
            and Manager
        •	Inquirer NPM Package – to prompt the user for email, ID, and specific information based on the role of 
            Engineer, Manager or Intern.
        •	Package json
        •	Jest – for running the tests
        •	Run as Node CLI to gather the information about each employee
        •	HTML Output File
